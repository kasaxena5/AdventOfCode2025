# Problem Statement

You have a tachyon manifold represented by a grid with a starting point 'S' that emits a tachyon beam downwards. The beam can encounter splitters '^' which create new beams going left and right as the original beam continues downward. Your task is to determine the total number of different timelines a single tachyon particle would end on after passing through the manifold, where at every splitter the particle goes both left and right simultaneously.

## Input Format

A grid containing 'S' for the starting point, '.' for empty space, and '^' for splitters. Each character is separated by spaces in a single line per row.

## Output Format

An integer representing the total number of different timelines the tachyon particle ends up on after traversing the manifold.
