# Problem Statement

You are given a diagram of a tachyon manifold. Tachyon beams enter the manifold at position marked 'S' and move downward. They can pass through empty space denoted by '.' but are stopped by splitters represented by '^'. New beams are emitted from the left and right of a splitter when a beam hits it. Your task is to determine how many times the beam gets split before exiting the manifold.

## Input Format

A grid of characters where 'S' indicates the starting point, '.' indicates empty space, and '^' indicates a splitter.

## Output Format

A single integer representing the total number of splits that occur before the beams exit the manifold.

## Sample Input

```
.......S.......
...............
.......^.......

```

## Sample Output

```
21
```

## Note
The Beam will split like the diagram below in the above example.
